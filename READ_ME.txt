IDEA FOR THE GAME:
The player will go through a maze where they will encounter enemies, collect items, and try to get to the tower.

WHAT IS WORKING?
- basic maze with lighting
- enemy with animations
- keys for the player to pick up

WHAT I'M STILL WORKING ON?
- game concept
- scene development
- start and end screens
- adding enemies
- adding items
- fixing and adding weapons
- optimizations. The way lighting is done might make the game slower. One idea is to have the player carry a torch
so that is the lighting instead of having several individual lights
- audio

OTHER NOTES:
- all models and animations were imported through the unity asset store
